# React Vite Material UI Starter Kit: Now with Extra Sparkles!

Welcome to what might just be the only project starter kit you'll ever need, unless you're into building something that doesn't use React, in which case... awkward. üê¢ This all-in-one magic potion combines the powers of Vite, React, Material UI, React Router, React Hook Form, MSW (Mock Service Worker), and React Testing Library to kickstart your web application into the stratosphere. Fasten your seatbelts!

## Features

- üöÄ **Faster Than Light**: With Vite, your development will be so fast, you'll finish yesterday.
- üé® **Dressed to Impress**: Thanks to Material UI, your app will look so sharp, it might cut through the internet.
- üß≠ **Navigate Like Magellan**: With React Router Dom, you'll never get lost, except maybe in your own code.
- üì° **Spying on APIs**: MSW will let you mock your API calls, so you can pretend you have a backend before you actually do.
- üìù **Forms That Don't Suck**: React Hook Form to the rescue, making form management a breeze, not a chore.
- üîç **Testing (Not the School Kind)**: React Testing Library for when you absolutely, positively need to test every motherlovin' component in your app.

## Design: Like a Tuxedo for Your App

There's a `theme` file lurking around that lets you slap your own style onto Material UI's defaults. It's like giving your app a makeover but without the reality TV drama. Plus, the drawer is so mobile-friendly, it practically sends you text messages to check how you're doing. Expect it to behave a bit differently on smaller screens, kind of like your pet when there's a thunderstorm.

## Examples: Show, Don't Tell

### Undercover Authentication

Dive into the `AuthProvider`, `SignIn`, `ProtectedRoute`, and `App` files to uncover the secrets of authentication. It's like a spy novel, but with more coding and less intrigue. The `App` treats `Dashboard` like a VIP area at a club ‚Äì no entry without logging in.

### Slow-Mo API Calls

Ever felt like your API calls were in too much of a hurry? `useQueryWithMinimumLoading` adds a leisurely 500ms to them, so your loading animations can gracefully twirl without disappearing in the blink of an eye.

### Playing God with APIs

Thanks to MSW, you can pretend to be the master of the API universe right from your `serverHandler.ts`. Check out `Order.test` for a peek at how to intercept those pesky API calls and bend them to your will.

## Getting Started: Unleash the Beast

### Before You Leap

Make sure you've got Node.js (preferably the LTS version because we like stability) and npm (because, well, you gotta install those packages).

### Installation: Summoning the Spirits

```bash
npm i
```
Or, chant "npm install" thrice under a full moon. Your call.

### Running: Let the Games Begin

```bash
npm run dev
```
This incantation activates your local server. Wizards preferred, but muggles with a command line can also succeed.

### Testing: Prove Your Worth

```bash
npm run test
```
For when you need to show off how bulletproof your components are. Or for when you just like seeing green checkmarks.

### Cloning: Because Sharing is Caring

Gotcha! No need to clone from the repository link provided. It's already here, and it's fabulous:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nelsonlarios/material-ui-vite.git
cd material-ui-vite
```

Now go forth and build something awesome. Just remember: with great power comes great responsibility (and occasionally, great bugs to fix). Happy coding!
